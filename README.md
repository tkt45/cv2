Replace the image_path variable with the path to the image you want to transform. You can upload your image to your Colab environment and specify the path accordingly.

Run the script.

The script will perform the following transformations on the input image:

Translation
Rotation
Scaling
Shearing
The original and transformed images will be displayed using Matplotlib.
